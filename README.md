# time_site

The purpose of this app is to eliminate the need to manually convert timezones when communicating with colleagues. When user select a contact to compose a messsage the user will be able to automatically see the actual time for their location along with their timezone. This will help the user to be mindful of the recipient's availability and inability to respond immediately.
